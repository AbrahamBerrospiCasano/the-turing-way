# Community Members and Shared Ownership

## Community members, contributors and co-authors

As a community-led project, we believe in and promote a collaborative approach to develop the content of this book.
Writing a chapter is an iterative process that involves designing, outlining, writing, reviewing, and editing its contents.
Similarly, community-oriented processes evolve over time with the help and feedback from the community.
Everyone who contributes to this book, no matter how small or big their contributions are, is recognised in this project as a contributor and a community member.

All the substantial contributors are named as co-authors on the book as a whole.
These contributions include carrying out the larger tasks such as writing a subchapter, maintaining community interactions, setting up infrastructure, helping others in their work and supporting their participation.

As stated in our [Governance document](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md), "Substantial" is a subjective term.
However, we have tried to add much detail as possible in the next subchapters through personas, contribution types and acknowledgements of those contributions including when a contributor is named as an author.

Authors are listed in alphabetical order by last name. The first author is always The Turing Way Community.
Authorship is cumulative.
If you have been added as an author on one release, you will stay as an author on all future releases.
If these subchapters do not contain the contribution type that you are interested in or if you would like to know whether you are eligible to be named as an author, please contact the core team by emailing [theturingway@gmail.com](mailto:theturingway@gmail.com).

## Creating opportunities for shared ownership

As an open-source community, the project invites contributions from the experts and enthusiasts alike to collectively develop guidance, recommendations, and practical resources that can foster a gold-standard for reproducible research.

_The Turing Way_ core team values and promotes a culture of collaboration.
In contrast to the traditional incentive structure in academia, which often discourages open collaboration, public engagements in project advancement and sharing data early on, we promote collaborative work culture in _The Turing Way_.

We intentionally avoid individual authorship in favor of establishing shared ownership and agency in this project.
This means that no single person or organisation owns the book or any of it's chapters.
The book belongs to the community and the chapters are always considered 'work in progress' so that they can evolve over time with newer contributions.
We encourage authors to actively involve others in reviewing their work, providing missing information and adding diverse examples, which are impossible to be written by a single person.

Such collaborative efforts also lower the psychological barriers for the new contributors who can propose improvements in the book by editing, moving, and adapting its content as the book grows.

Furthermore, with our commitment for fair acknowledgement in this project, we create opportunities to highlight the work they've done without trying to fit _The Turing Way_ into a traditional credit system.

## Highlight your contributions!

In the {ref}`next subchapter <ch-acknowledgement-record>`, we have listed all the documents in this project that is considered "Record of Contributions" that every contributor can edit to document their work that they want to highlight in _The Turing Way_.

We want our community members to take pride in the valuable work they have done this project and invite their suggestion in improving ways we acknowledge them.
