# What is the Guide to Ethical Research?

This is one of the books that make up [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome), an open source community-driven guide to reproducible, ethical, inclusive and collaborative data science.

# Who can contribute? 

This is a collaborative project: we are working together to share our knowledge, understanding and experience to build and learn together. Please don't feel like you need to already be an expert to contribute! We really want to hear from researchers, scientists and those who work with data, who want to talk about ethics in research and be part of a learning process - in their own work and as part of a community. 

If you're interested in ethical research, we want to hear from you!

# I've found something useful and I want to share it in another venue!
